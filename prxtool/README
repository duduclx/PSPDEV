PRXTool: A simple tool to manipulate Sony PSP(tm) PRX files.

PRXTool is licensed under the AFL v2.0. Please read the LICENSE file for further 
information.

This README is going to be short and to the point.

Installation:

Do the old ./bootstrap and ./configure thing, then type make (or gmake). You can
then install the tool if you want using make install.

Example:

./bootstrap; ./configure; make; make install

Usage:

Prxtool is designed for a number of functions, it can output an IDC file for use in 
IDA Pro. It can output an ELF file from a PRX, it can also dissassemble the PRX 
into a pretty printed form.

Anyway this is a good companion to libdoc as that provides the XML file used to 
get names and such for functions.
