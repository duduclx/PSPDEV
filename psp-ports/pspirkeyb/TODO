bugs:

* Scancode mode is not 100% ok - you can't map KEY_Y to KEY_Z and KEY_Z to KEY_Y
  this is an endless loop :) Probably a won't fix bug.

missing:

* UFT-8 for map files isn't working
* check if baudrate change works
* IsKeyDown( raw ), IsModifierDown( struct SModifier ) is missing

nice to have:

* add some pictures of the keyboards to a website
* add a PSP button emulation mode
* maybe write a patch for psplink to use it as input
* maybe write a prx to export keyboard events to the pads (like remotejoy)
* make ir baudrate change work without kernel - or detect if we run in
  kernel mode (stack segment position?) and remove he parameter "kernel"
  from the init function
* add a power down/up handler
