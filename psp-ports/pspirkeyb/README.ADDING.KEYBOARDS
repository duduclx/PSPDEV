1) Get familiar with the keyboard!
2) Google for pspirdacapture.zip
	Play around and find out what the keyboard sends to PSP
	You might have to use your PC if the keyboard has a non 9600
	baud mode.
3) Add a new enum to pspirkeyb.h
4) Add a new function handler to pspirkeyb.c and update pspIrKeybSetKeyboard()
5) Add a raw mode map to kbdkeyboards.h
6) Add a new keyboard map to keymap
7) Test with irkeybtest in RAW mode and SCAN mode

-> Send the patch :)
